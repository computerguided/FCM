# Functional Components Method

The Functional Components Method (FCM) is a comprehensive approach for developing, managing, and interacting with software components. FCM emphasizes modularity, reusability, and efficient communication between distinct functional units, called components. It uses a structured framework that includes devices, message queues, state transition tables, and handlers, aiming to create scalable and maintainable software architectures. By adopting FCM, developers can build systems that are easier to debug, test, and extend, ultimately resulting in more robust and flexible applications.

Find detailed information in the [FCM wiki](https://github.com/computerguided/FCM/wiki).

For an example, see the ["Doors Controlling System"](https://github.com/computerguided/FCM-example).

This repository contains a C++ implementation (a C implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/computerguided/FCM_C)).

As a structured method, FCM allows for generating parts of the documentation and code. The [FCM Tools](https://github.com/computerguided/fcm-tools) repository provides tools for this purpose.
