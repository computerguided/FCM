# Functional Component Method framework

This repository contains the source code for the C++ implemention of the Functional Component Method framework.

The Functional Component Method (FCM) is a comprehensive approach designed to facilitate the development, management, and interaction of components within a software system. At its core, FCM emphasizes modularity, reusability, and efficient communication between distinct functional units, known as _components_. This method leverages a structured framework that includes devices, message queues, state transition tables, and various handlers to streamline the process of creating scalable and maintainable software architectures. By adopting FCM, developers can create systems that are easier to debug, test, and extend, ultimately leading to more robust and flexible applications.

Detailed design documentation is available in the [FCM/doc](./FCM/doc/README.md) folder. The source code for the framework is located in the [FCM](./FCM) folder.
